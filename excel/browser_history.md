Simple table: date, key, link.
Find duplicates based on link and remove.
To finding duplicate links, sort by link, select column and then do conditional formatting -> highlight cell rules -> duplicate values.
In general keep things sorted by key, then by date. To reopen stuff, find the key and then pick the links necessary.
Remove links when done. Keep it simple.
