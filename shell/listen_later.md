Copy the text you want to listen later on your phone on the go. Now run below command on your dropbox

```
~/Dropbox $ pbpaste | say -o file_name
```

Above command will pipe copied content to `say` command and generate the output file `file_name.aiff` in your dropbox folder.
Now you can listen to this on the go! Enjoy!
